# Prototype-self-driving-car-based-on-image-processing-using-Haar-Cascade-Classifier

This project aims to design and implement a prototype robocar system which capable of driving independently in a safe manner.

this project is divided into two parts, In the robotic part which will play the actuator part a Lego EV3 Mindstorm Robot has been used to implement the Prototype robocar.

On the other hand, in the image processing Part which will be used as a sensor part, Viola-Jones object-detection algorithm has been used, Viola-Jones object detector is one of the most successful and widely used object detection  algorithms. Moreover, since training the classifier is one of the most important steps of the Viola-Jones algorithm.

In this project 10 stages trained Haar Cascade classifier has been implemented using more than 1800 images as positive images and 900 images as negative images in a way that the system becomes capable of detecting objects in live camera streaming with such a high efficiency and accuracy within such a short time. 

As a result, in the final phase of this project, using OpenCV, EmguCV, and C# programming language and Lego EV3 Mindstorm libraries we have been able to design and implement a robocar system based on object detection and recognition algorithm that will be able to navigate itself safely. and detect the presence of traffic signs and behave accordingly.
